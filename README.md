# DeepSpeed-CompressionAnalysis

Embedding Analysis and Analysis of Performance under Adversarial Attack for ZeroQuant and XTC

---

### Aim of Project 

In this Repository I plan to explore the new ZeroPapers by Microsoft and the python Library DeepSpeed. 

I plan to explore the XTC and ZeroQuant Compression techniques and visualize the changes to the embedding space and also look at performance under adversarial attacks.

### Overall Project Plan as of 3rd August.

1. [ ] Read the ZeroPapers
2. [ ] Install DeepSpeed and Run Compression Examples
3. [ ] Use Glue Dataset <> 
4. [ ] Use bert models from huggingface and fine-tune on choosen dataset
5. [ ] Perform Deep Speed Compression using DeepSpeed Compression
6. [ ] Perform Student-Teacher distillation technique used by distilbert.
7. [ ] Use TextAttack to run Adversarial Attacks on Original Model and Compressed Models. 
8. [ ] Perform Embedding Analysis
